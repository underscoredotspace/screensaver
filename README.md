# Mac Plus Screensaver Starter Kit

## How to start up

- Install dependencies with npm or Yarn (`npm i` / `yarn`)
- Run with `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Open in your browser at [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/)

The project is using ParcelJS to run a dev server automatically. While the dev server is running, saved changes in `src` will be `pushed` to the browser, normally without having to refresh the page. 

## Additional stuff
To help you get aquainted with JavaScript, I've put together some pointers on Codepen: 

1. [Objects are passed by reference](https://codepen.io/_dotSpace/pen/XeyKZg)
2. [JS is asynchronous](https://codepen.io/_dotSpace/pen/EwOyWX)
3. [Functions are values](https://codepen.io/_dotSpace/pen/ZXmLbQ)
4. [Callbacks are functions passed as parameters](https://codepen.io/_dotSpace/pen/XeypMM)
